## KILT Staking

The Stakeboard is an open-source staking platform built for the KILT protocol. The Stakeboard features enable users to add, remove and change stakes for the available Collators. It is currently compatible with [Sporran wallet](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension) and [Polkadot js Extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension).

### Contribution

Contributing to the Stakeboard requires the contributor to follow the guidelines set in the [KILT dev docs](https://dev.kilt.io).

## Getting Started

The Stakeboard requires a connection to the KILT chain. 

**Recommended: Do not use the live net for testing**

For testing purposes, the Stakeboard is connected to the KILT test net Peregrine by default. If you wish to use a local chain for testing, you can be connect by changing the `ENDPOINT` in the `src/utils/useConnect.ts` file.

Run the following commands to install dependencies and start developing

```js
yarn install
yarn start
```

**NEED PEREGRINE TEST TOKENS?** Go to our [testnet faucet](https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io/).
