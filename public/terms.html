          <h2>What the KILT Stakeboard is</h2>

          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard allows you to manage your staking on the KILT
            Blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, you can</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              see how many stakeable KILT Coins you have in each of your
              identities or addresses
            </li>
            <li>
              display how many you have staked with each of your identities or
              addresses
            </li>
            <li>
              display which collator you back, with which identity or address
            </li>
            <li>display how many KILT Coins you can still stake</li>
            <li>
              prepare a transaction to stake or to increase or decrease your
              staking amount
            </li>
            <li>
              have the transaction you would need for your changed staking
              amount calculated
            </li>
            <li>
              transfer this prepared transaction to your wallet for signature to
              be processed by the KILT Blockchain.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Also, the KILT Stakeboard reads from the KILT blockchain or
            third-party applications and shows you
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the stakes for each collator</li>
            <li>stake of respective collator + delegators staked on them</li>
            <li>ranking of the collators</li>
            <li>which collator is/isn’t actively creating blocks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The data generated in and for your staking activities is stored
            locally on your device. The balances displayed are based on the
            information currently stored on the KILT blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to the KILT Stakeboard is made through your wallet and all
            transactions prepared in the KILT Stakeboard will need to be signed
            via the wallet through which the KILT Coins are accessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any rewards received for your staking will automatically go to the
            same identity or address where your stake comes from.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>NOTE: Professional crypto staker</h2>

          <p>
            The KILT Stakeboard is aimed exclusively at professional crypto
            stakers who have familiarised themselves sufficiently with staking
            and the resulting rewards, as well as the prerequisites and
            calculation of these rewards in the KILT ecosystem, so that they
            fully understand the impact their actions on the KILT Stakeboard can
            have.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the KILT Stakeboard, you declare that you are a
            professional crypto staker, i.e. to act as entrepreneur and not in
            your capacity as a Consumer. Entrepreneur is any natural person or
            legal entity who, when using the KILT Stakeboard, acts in exercise
            of its commercial or self-employed professional activity.
          </p>

          <h2>Staking, Investment, Legal or Tax Advice</h2>

          <p>
            Nothing published by the KILT Foundation should be interpreted as
            staking or investment advice. KILT Foundation is in no way providing
            trading, staking or investment advice. Please consult with your
            appropriate licensed professional before making any financial
            transactions, including any investments related to ideas or opinions
            expressed, past, present, or future by the aforementioned entity and
            any existing or future entities that may operate under the parent
            entities. KILT Foundation does not intend to express financial,
            legal, tax, or any other advice and any conclusions drawn from
            statements made by, or on, KILT Foundation shall not be deemed to
            constitute advice in any jurisdiction. Information is provided for
            practical, educational and amusement purposes only.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Liability</h2>

          <p>
            The KILT Foundation is liable for damages that are based on an
            intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the KILT
            Foundation, its legal representatives or various agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, KILT
            Foundation shall only be liable for the contractually typical,
            foreseeable damage if this was simply cause by negligence.
            Significant contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment
            enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and
            whose compliance you can regularly rely on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the
            legal representatives and various agents of KILT Foundation, if
            claims are asserted directly against them. The liability limitations
            resulting from the two preceding paragraphs do not apply insofar as
            KILT Foundation fraudulently concealed the defect or assumed a
            guarantee for the quality of KILT Stakeboard.
          </p>

          <p>Any additional claims for damages are excluded.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Risk information</h2>

          <p>
            The following risk information contains a list of risks associated
            with the use of KILT Stakeboard. The list is not exhaustive. It is
            not excluded that further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard is used on your system as a web application and to
            prepare transactions to be signed with your wallet. For the security
            of your wallet, it is essential that your system is not compromised
            with malware. Please make sure that this is the case, because
            malware running unnoticed in the background, for example a key
            tracker, represents a major security risk for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard communicates with the KILT Blockchain and depends on
            its functionality. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of
            KILT Blockchain or the technical ecosystem in which it lives may
            adversely affect the KILT Stakeboard or the information available
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            KILT Stakeboard and in particular the underlying software
            application may be the subject of hacking or other malicious
            interference by unauthorised third parties resulting in the loss,
            theft or other violation of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you want to use the KILT Stakeboard in the version tested and
            finalised by us, always make sure to use it via stakeboard.kilt.io.
            Otherwise, there is a risk that a third party may unconsciously or
            knowingly incorporate errors leading to potential adverse
            consequences for the usability and functionality of their copy or
            amended version of the KILT Stakeboard not controlled by us anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be absolutely sure that the transaction is correct and reflects
            what you wanted, always check the information and data in your
            wallet before signing the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication via internet-based systems is fundamentally
            susceptible to data/information being read and possibly even
            changed. We have no influence on which processes (now and in the
            future) run in the background of the web browser used.
